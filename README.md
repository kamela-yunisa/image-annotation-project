Independent project: Object detection annotation using bounding boxes

## About This Project
Manual annotation of self-created dataset with bounding boxes for object detection. Images contain everyday items (books, pens, pencils, rulers) captured in various arrangements and lighting conditions.

**Skills demonstrated:**
- Object detection and bounding box annotation
- Attention to detail and annotation consistency
- Dataset organization and documentation
- Image annotation tool proficiency

**Tools used:** VGG Image Annotator

## Project Details
- Source: 50 self-created images
